    <h2 style="color: rgb(156, 117, 192);">Movie Night! Fight Club: The most entertaining identity crisis</h2>

<div class="acenter">
    <p>
        David Fincher's Fight Club (1999) is a cult classic that has been interpreted countless of ways, however you may not have heard of the theory that the only real entity in the film is our protagonist. It is interesting to note that Norton’s character does not have a name despite being our main protagonist, he is widely referred to as ‘The Narrator’ which supports the idea of him being the only real person and he is telling the tale of his crumbling psyche. Now, you may be wondering ‘how can everyone else be fake too? That makes no sense’. And I understand, when I first considered this it seemed ridiculous but upon revisiting particular scenes and giving it some more thought it seems plausible. I believe that Fight Club is a film about an identity crisis- and yes i can hear you saying ‘obviously! Tyler Durden?!’ but wait, I mean a huge identity crisis about the oldest obsession in the book. Masculinity.

        It’s no secret that Fight Club reeks with toxic masculinity, but where it gets confusing is whether the audience should feel aligned with the sentiment behind Tyler Durden’s Fight Club or Project Mayhem or dissect the red flags waving above their heads. A lot of viewers overlook the significance of characters like Robert (Bob) Paulson and Marla Singer, and how they portray the Narrator grappling with his feelings of masculinity and femininity. The opening scene of the film is our Narrator attending a testicular cancer support group, instantly there is an established fear and pain over losing your sense of masculinity. Bob is a walking dichotomy of masculinity and femininity as a large, former builder who had his testicles removed and grew large breasts as a symptom of his hormone therapy, as well as his sensitive disposition. He is a broken man who was left by his wife and no longer has contact with his children. If we are to believe that Bob is another persona created by the Narrator, then we must be open to the possibility that he truly does have testicular cancer and his diagnosis may be what triggered the creation of this character for his fears to be projected on; at no point in the film does the Narrator reach out to any real family or friends, and his insomnia and dissociative identity disorder make him an unreliable narrator.

        Marla appears as a pressure point for our Narrator, he is stressed out immediately upon seeing her for the first time. Marla, obviously, represents a more distinctly feminine perspective for our Narrator. The first notable example of the Narrator ‘becoming’ Marla is when they go to the laundromat and Marla takes some clothes out of a machine before going to a pawn shop to sell them. Interestingly, Marla only grabs pairs of mens jeans to sell which may imply the Narrator briefly relinquishing his masculinity. This idea of costume comes up again later when Marla shows the Narrator the dress she bought and tells him ‘you can borrow it sometime’. Marla says she thrifted the dress which could mean that the Narrator picked it up at the same shop he went to sell the jeans, trading one costume for another. A more subtle example of Marla’s ‘threat’ to the Narrator’s masculinity is when she is standing outside of a support group as the Narrator looks at her from a distance. She is holding something in her hand, it is initially difficult to make out, but if the levels and colour of the frame are adjusted, you can make out that she is holding a dildo. Another hint of Marla taking the Narrator's masculinity, or him surrendering it to her.

        While I maintain that all other characters in this film are created by Norton’s character (including the house he squats in- Paper Street: a street or road that appears on maps but has not been built), we will solely focus on this trio as they are the most significant representations of different stages of the Narrator’s journey. Tylers toxic masculinity and Marla's femininity act as a striking binary opposition throughout the film that keeps the Narrator on his toes at all times. And Bob represents the confusing mix of the two as the Narrator goes on his journey to figure out who he is. After leaving Bob and Marla to live with Tyler, he finds himself reintroducing them into his life. Marla comes back first, but the Narrator is still resistant to her presence, but is more welcoming to Bob, conveying to the audience that he is still feeling lost. When the Narrator bumps into Bob again, there is graffiti on the wall behind him that says ‘I like ‘=myself four times’. ‘Myself, myself, myself, myself’ aka ‘Narrator, Tyler, Marla, Bob’.

        Bob’s death tells the audience that the Narrator is close to deciding whether he wants to be aligned with Tyler or Marla and doesn’t need Bob in the centre anymore. At the end of the film, the Narrator sprints around the city without pants on after the confrontation at the police station once again disposing of pants suggesting that he has surrendered his masculinity and has chosen Marla. Both Bob and Tyler are killed by a bullet to the brain, the Narrator is the last man standing and he has chosen to balance his life with Marla’s. The closing shot shows the two hand in hand facing the city, and their silhouettes are nearly identical: Marla’s hair has been consistently wild throughout the film and after running around and ‘fighting’ the Narrator’s hair is just as wild. Marla is wearing a black dress and long coat, which is mirrored by the Narrator's long black shirt.

        It is up to you how to interpret this journey that the Narrator goes on, there is room to argue that this story is a trans allegory. Personally, I’m not so sure. Judith Butler suggests that gender is a performance, that the constructions of masculinity and femininity are imposed upon us by a heteronormal society. As I said earlier: Tyler Durden, Fight Club and Project Mayhem are products of toxic masculinity. The prescribed role for men at its most extreme. It may not be that the Narrator isn’t a man, but he has realised how unrealistic and dangerous the mindset society has about presenting masculinity and unweaved the web of his psyche to figure out who he really is and how he wants to live.

        There are so many more examples of the world around the Narrator as a construction of his mind, such as Bob being inspired by a victim of one of the car crashes the Narrator evaluates, a large man who was a father wearing the same plaid blue shirt from the first scene we meet Bob. throughout this film- again, this article is only focused on three of the characters. Locations such as the Paper Street and the hotel Marla stays in, and characters like Raymond K Hessel and ‘Angel Face’ still leave even more to be discussed. And for any one still in doubt, when the Narrator is first officially introduced to Tyler, the exit scene on the plane shows a woman stepping out the door and she is replaced by a man in the final image. Marla being switched out for Tyler. Marla packing for the flight may also explain the luggage problem ;) Okay, I'll stop. For now.
