    <h2 style="color: rgb(156, 117, 192);">Movie Night! A beautiful short film of Northwest nature</h2>

<div class="acenter">
    <p>
        The northwest is best known for Manchester, a beloved concrete jungle. Manchester is a special place, the heart of our home. But it often draws our attention from nature's beauties with its flashing lights and 20% off sales. Jordan Hargreave wanted to remind us to appreciate the small things in life, and that is what he set out to do with his new short film ‘Breathe Easy’ which came out last week. This is Hargreave’s third short film, following the success of his 2017 darling ‘Finding Solace’ which centres around the mental decline of a young man after losing his friend. Before long he starts seeing his friend's ghost, encouraging him to reach out to other friends and his family members.

        ‘Breathe Easy’ follows a young girl who runs away after an argument with her mum. She runs into the forest as she cries, and leans against a tree, slumping down to the ground.
